The decoding part works without any issues, however I am having a very hard time getting the simulation to work correctly. I cant quite figure out how to get the data to display correct and a hard time getting the test2 bin file show only the 148 location. Also there are some simulation outputs that do not match correctly, but most of the first cycles match on each test for the registers.
